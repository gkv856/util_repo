## Concepts

This section explores key concepts and techniques in artificial intelligence, providing in-depth explanations and practical examples to aid your understanding. Whether you're learning about different types of loss functions, the importance of data normalization, or the role of optimizers in training neural networks, you'll find valuable insights and resources here.

### Loss Function

A loss function is a crucial component in training machine learning models, as it quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values. In this section, we delve into various types of loss functions commonly used in AI, such as mean squared error (MSE), cross-entropy loss, and hinge loss, discussing their properties and applications.

### Normalization

Normalization is a preprocessing technique used to scale and center data, ensuring that features are comparable and preventing issues like vanishing gradients during training. Here, we explore different normalization methods such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and batch normalization, illustrating their effects on model performance and convergence.

### Optimizer

An optimizer is responsible for updating the parameters of a model during training in order to minimize the loss function. This section covers popular optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, explaining their mechanisms and hyperparameters to help you choose the right optimizer for your neural network.
